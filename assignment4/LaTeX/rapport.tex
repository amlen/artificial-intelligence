\section{The Wedding Problem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare the 2 strategies implemented in the previous question between each other and with randomwalk, defined in search.py on the given wedding instances. Report in a table, the computation time, the value of the best solution and the number of steps when the best result was reached. For the second and third strategies, each instance should be tested 10 times to eliminate effects of the randomness on the result. When multiple run of the same instance are executed, report the means of the quantities.

    \item Answer the following questions:
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item What is the best strategy ?
    			\begin{framed}
    			\end{framed}
    		\item Why do you think the best strategy beats the other ones ?
    			\begin{framed}
    			\end{framed}
    		\item What are the limitations of each strategy in terms of diversification and intensification ?
    			\begin{framed}
    			\end{framed}
    		\item What is the behaviour of the different techniques when they fall in a local optimum.

% Propositionnal logic
\section{Propositional logic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each instance below, give it's number of valid interpretations, i.e. the number of times the sentence is true (considering for each sentence all the proposition variables A, B , C an D).
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item $(A \wedge \lnot B) \vee (B \wedge \lnot C)$
    			\begin{framed}
    			\end{framed}
    		\item $(A \Rightarrow \lnot B) \wedge \lnot(C \vee \lnot D)$
    			\begin{framed}
    			\end{framed}
    	\end{enumerate}
    	
    \item Explain how you can express this problem with propositional logic. What are the variables and how do you translate the relations and the query ? 
    	\begin{framed}
    	\end{framed}
    
    \item Translate your model into Conjonctive Normal Form (CNF) and write it in your report.
